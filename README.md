# CyberDetect
CyberDetect is a project that identifies and flags instances of cyberbullying in text-based content using cutting-edge technology. By analysing text input and giving immediate feedback on whether it contains characteristics of cyberbullying or not, it contributes to the creation of a safer online environment.
