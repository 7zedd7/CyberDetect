# CyberDetect
CyberDetect is a project that identifies and flags instances of cyberbullying in text-based content using cutting-edge technology. By analysing text input and giving immediate feedback on whether it contains characteristics of cyberbullying or not, it contributes to the creation of a safer online environment.

For online platforms, social media networks, and organisations working to stop cyberbullying and make the internet a safer place, this initiative is a useful tool. CyberDetect provides proactive detection and response to occurrences of cyberbullying by utilising machine learning techniques.

As we collaborate to enhance the capability of detecting cyberbullying and encourage appropriate online behaviour, contributions, feedback, and partnerships are encouraged.
