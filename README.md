# CyberDetect
🔍 CyberDetect is a project that identifies and flags instances of cyberbullying in text-based content using cutting-edge technology. 👀 By analysing text input and giving immediate feedback on whether it contains characteristics of cyberbullying or not, it contributes to the creation of a safer online environment. 🌐

For online platforms, social media networks, and organisations working to stop cyberbullying and make the internet a safer place, this initiative is a useful tool. 💪🌐 CyberDetect provides proactive detection and response to occurrences of cyberbullying by utilising machine learning techniques. 🚀🔍

As we collaborate to enhance the capability of detecting cyberbullying and encourage appropriate online behaviour, contributions, feedback, and partnerships are encouraged. 🤝🔍💻🚀
